To run TujiFund on your phone, you have a couple of options:
Option 1: Run as a web app accessed from your phone

You would need to:

    Host the application on a server (this could be a cloud service like Heroku, Vercel, or Netlify)
    Deploy your app to this hosting service
    Access the hosted website from your phone's browser

Option 2: Convert to a mobile app using a framework

Since we've built this as a React web app, you can use one of these approaches:

    React Native conversion (most work but best result):
        The app would need to be rewritten using React Native components
        Replace web-specific libraries with React Native equivalents
        This gives true native performance but requires significant rewriting

    Use a wrapper like Capacitor or Cordova (easiest):
        Install Capacitor: npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli
        Initialize Capacitor: npx cap init TujiFund com.yourname.tujifund
        Add platforms: npx cap add android and/or npx cap add ios
        Build your web app: npm run build
        Copy web code to native platform: npx cap copy
        Open in Android Studio/Xcode: npx cap open android or npx cap open ios
        Then build the app using the native development environment

    Progressive Web App (PWA) approach (simplest):
        Add PWA capabilities to your current app with service workers
        Add a manifest.json file
        Implement offline capabilities
        Users can then "install" it to their home screen from the browser

For your specific app, the Capacitor approach would probably be the quickest way to get a mobile app working on your phone without major code changes, while still having it feel like a native app.

Would you like me to help you implement one of these approaches?
